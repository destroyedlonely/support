# TSA Admin Guide
{: .no_toc }

## Table of contents

1. TOC
{:toc}

TSA is BloxStreet's administrative system and anti-exploit, custom developed by axcracy and TheCakeChicken. TSA takes the form of a Discord bot, Roblox module, and administrative web panel. Those with TSA permissions can utilize these to perform their duties.

### Commands
{: .text-red-300 }
#### 1A - Permission Levels
{: .text-grey-dk-000 }
{: .no_toc }
All members who are ranked Store Supervisor+ will gain access to various commands. Ranks and their respective admin levels are shown below. 

| Rank        | Admin Level         | 
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Store Supervisor           | Moderator | 
| Assistant Manager | Moderator   | 
| Store Manager           | Moderator     | 
| Store Director          | Admin | 
| Board of Directors          | Admin | 
| Executive Assistant           | Admin | 
| Store Executive         | Admin | 
| Junior Moderator           | Super Admin | 
| Senior Moderator          | Super Admin | 
| Head Moderator           | Super Admin | 
| Store Developer          | Creator | 
| Group Owner           | Creator | 

Depending on the role, certain commands can be executed. For example, users with Moderator commands **cannot** run :pban. However, players with Super Admin may.

#### 1B - Executing Commands
{: .text-grey-dk-000 }
{: .no_toc }
When executing commands, ensure they are being utilized correctly. 

 
    * EX: ; (Console Opens) 
      
      **_exploitlogs_**

      (Exploit logs GUI is then shown as expected) 
      
### Anti-Exploit
{: .text-red-300 }
As mentioned at the start of this document, TSA features a built-in anti-exploit system, which keeps out exploiters. The anti-exploit system automatically permanently bans or kicks depending on the severity. 

* All detected exploits can be viewed with the :exploitlogs command. Please do not stay under the impression that :exploitlogs will show exploiters who are currently in the server and show what they are doing. The system cannot detect everything and only logs when an exploiter is automatically banned.
* If a player appears in :exploitlogs, there is no need to request in-game assistance, as the exploiter has more than likely been banned by TSA's anti-exploit. If an exploiter is present, contact an available HR, attempt to gather sufficient evidence, and open a ticket.

### Downtime
{: .text-red-300 }
Downtime is a time in which a critical error has occurred within the code, stopping all commands being run, and by extension, your admin being given.

Click [here](https://status.bloxstreet.store) to view the status of various TSA services.

* In this scenario, the Head Moderators+ kindly request that players do not spam ping us, DM us repeatedly, or anything of the sort when this occurs. Doing so can lead to consequences. Group Developers have likely been informed of the problems and are working diligently to fix them. 
* A simple fix may just be rejoining. If a server shuts down, many players rejoining at the same time can overload the system and may cause admin loading to be delayed. For this reason, we request that players wait a few minutes before rejoining.

### Acceptable Usage
{: .text-red-300 }
This is the main section of the document. It will outline the acceptable and unacceptable usages of admin commands.

All major admin abuse (running :pban all, etc.) is logged and will result in an instant punishment! The command will be immediately canceled, and SHRs will be notified.

#### 4A - All Commands Usage
{: .text-grey-dk-000 }
{: .no_toc }

When executing commands, be sure to type at least 50% of the player's username.


| Command Name | Description |

| :respawn / :res / :refresh / :ref | Use this command to respawn yourself and anybody who may request it. You may NOT do :respawn all or respawn users who do not request a respawn. |
| :kick (Store Director+) | Use this command to update in-game ranks, kick failed or passed LRs at a training session, or for any other valid reason. |
| :ban (Store Director+) | Use this command for trollers, rule violators, removing a blacklisted or permanently banned user, or for  other valid reason. |

| :shutdown (Junior Moderator+ & the host of a training) | Use this command to conclude a training session after everyone is finished. SHRs may use this command if several players are banned from a server as a result of an admin abuse attack, for development updates, or if a server is lagging and nonfunctional. This command may not be used without valid reasoning. |
| :slock / unslock (Host of a training session) | Use this command to lock a training session at :00. This command should not be used to unlock a server during a training session. |
